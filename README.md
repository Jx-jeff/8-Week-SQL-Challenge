# 8 WEEK SQL CHALLENGE

In today's data-driven world 🌎, SQL is an essential skill for anyone who wants to navigate data 🚤 and unearth ⛏⛏ hidden insights within. After months of soaking YouTube videos and tackling guided projects, I'm thrilled  to start **Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL Challenge**. 

This repository will serve as a practice ground playground for putting my SQL skills to the test. Each month, I'll conquer ⚔ at least 2 new challenges. My solutions will be documented ✍ here using a folder for each case.

Feel free to share any contributions and point out mistakes when made. My goal for this project is to ultimately improve my SQL queries 💪 and your feedback will greatly contribute to achieving this goal  

Thanks 😊😉
